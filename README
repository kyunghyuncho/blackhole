The data is in grs1915_all_125ms.dat
This is a pickle file with a long list of >2000 elements. Each element in turn is a list with two elements:
1) The time series in 4 different photon energy ranges in a numpy.ndarray
2) a label, either a string (if a human classification is available for that data set) or None

The numpy.ndarray with the time series is of form (length of time series, 5); the five columns are:
1) A time stamp in Mission Elapsed Seconds (essentially seconds since Jan 1 1992); the time resolution is 125ms (that is, the time stamps are 125ms apart
2) The number of photons that arrived at the detector within the 125ms interval at all photon energies observable by the telescope (X-ray astronomers work in energy rather than wavelength of the light, but it's essentially the same thing)
3) The number of photons that arrived at the detector within the 125ms interval in the low-energy band
4) The number of photons that arrived at the detector within the 125ms interval in the mid-energy band
5) The number of photons that arrived at the detector within the 125ms interval in the high-energy band

Columns 3-5 should roughly sum up to the value in column 2, though it might not be an exact correspondence.
